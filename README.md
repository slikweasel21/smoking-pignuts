#This will be my contribution to the art of dark mischief and revenge tactics. Only the tried and true here. There is much danger to be had in some techniques. 
If you have The Fear, leave now, and do not attempt any techniques listed herein. There is no shame in the cowardice of burning off your face with virgin sulfuric.
If you are intentionally ignorant and do not know simple chemistry, thermodynamics, or simple physics, please leave now. Go learn them and come back. You won't be as stupid.

It takes a certain breaking point I think. Where life has handed you just one loving spoonful too much. You may sit there and cry. I felt tears come close but the bottle 
welcomed my mornings for a month. Then I got fucking pissed, not the rage self-destructing meathead punching through the drywall pissed. The cool sweat on your forehead,
way too intense stare from your eyes pissed. Determined pissed. I plotted and before I knew it I was consumed with inventive conspiracy and strategic destruction. Entirely engrossed in
my mission to develop a different way of enacting whatever I deemed enough for those who had earned my ire. I may slip in a tale here or there as this tips and tricks guide developed.
In the end, I caused much misery, some of which I have regrets...slightly. Some of which the mere thought of still makes my mouth curl up on both sides thinking of the stress,
hard times, and completely undetected ruin I had caused the subject of my time in creating the Death by 1000 Needles.

Some fairly simple rules developed as I went along learning from my mistakes, but also trying hard to avoid making any in the first place. I'll start there.

1. Always strive for perfection in an action you take. You must attempt to locate any prospect of creating blowback. In the present and the future. Examine your action with that lens.
You will rarely find a zero-risk action. The actions with the smallest risk involved are golden. No matter how trivial they may seem. Risk-free is the way to be. Risk-free with major damage
now that is what I am always looking for.
2. Keep your quest and your skills to yourself. This may seem obvious, however, in the depth of an obsession to enact the total package in perfection you can slip. It's easy to
slip when your every waking moment your mind is pursuing options and everything else is secondary. The risks of disobeying this rule are larger than most others. People can turn on you.
Circumstances change, shit happens and people become things they never were before. You can't predict these things so you must mitigate the risk by only being Clark Kent.
3. I was taught this by a great friend 24 years my younger but older in some ways than I can yet fathom. Whenever you are traversing physically any room, store, or any place at all examine everything.
You don't have to stop and ponder just notice, what brand are the locks, how they operate, how they cease to operate, and whether the doors fire doors or hollow core. When in a store, how could this
eye dropper in the infant section be repurposed if needed, which of these cleaners contain what kind of chemicals, which are a mixture, and which are homogenous of one solution or compound? With enough
fortitude and practice doing this, you will achieve a higher level of awareness than most people around you. It is a gift, it is power, and it is amazing. Once achieved you will notice the others on
your plane very quickly. They are rare, but not that rare if you understand that statement. These people can be your greatest allies or your worst nemesis. Tread softly.
4. Safety. This is no fucking joke here. There is equipment necessitated because if you don't have it something will eventually go wrong and the difference between, "fuck that's some shit luck",
and "Oh fuck, the whole house is on fire", or "Christ how was I to know at 50 degrees that reaction would produce chlorine gas instead of shooting flames?" Prepare for the worst, bare minimum
first aid kit, nitrile gloves, face shield, welders cap or safe hat, fire extinguishers of correct size and type, adhesives of all kinds, gorilla tape, face coverings in case anonymity is necessitated
from cameras, a can of bear mace, and don't be cheap. There is more I haven't listed I'll try and add as I run into use cases. With anything you do think about what could happen in a one-in-a-hundred-thousand
scenario. Prepare accordingly, the car always has a charged LiON jumper pack, jumper cables, inflated spare, jack, fix a flat, spare oil, and coolant. Perpetrating major mischief and not being able to jet
when you need to is a cardinal sin.
5. Start utilizing social engineering skills on a small scale daily. Get used to lying if you aren't good at it. When you are paying for gas make up some semi fantastical story and tell it to the clerk.
Entertain them, keep them occupied. As you get better think of what things you could accomplish on a mark if needed. You don't need to be doing long-haul feats of engineering on your frequent people. Don't. They notice. Strangers and occasional acquaintances. Push your limits, and see what you can accomplish. Print yourself a press badge and walk around random places entering businesses and
asking questions. Fear nothing while doing so. The world is your playground now, you will start to realize the change has already materialized. You may not have known you were a sheep, but you sure do
feel different turning into a wolf.
6. If you find a mark of the primary fashion, one whom you are going to bring hell itself down upon, the death by 1000 needles you need to plan. You need to be organized and keep records either cipher or encrypted at
times. Remember 5 little annoyances first thing in the morning can wreck a whole day. Small is not necessarily trivial when your revenge itinerary has 45 actions on it. Plan your marks days, the misfortune and severities
of each attack. Your goal is to build anxiety, discontent, negativity, anger, sadness, and self-loathing, all those are your end goals. You can cause far more pain with a simple letter in the mail than you can beat
the ever-living fuck out of somebody with a Louisville Slugger. If you do decide the subject is a primary mark, make sure you know what you are about to do. Make sure you can live with what happens. You will develop
techniques on your own catered to your mark that are so cruel you wonder if you are becoming a sociopath. Valid question, I wondered for a bit, and then suddenly I realized, I'm good, satisfied. I fucked this motherfucking
piece of shit's life upside down for three years and he didn't have a clue.  A terrible three years for him. Full of loss, pain, rejection, flat tires, blown engines, strange questions from authorities, angry farmers, and
other things I can only assume were acts of god. It was at that point I realized he might have cut me deep once and been gloating about it, but I bent him over and fucked him hard for three years. So bad his face aged
ten. If you think you will want to tell your mark about your handiwork, you might a little at first, but then you won't. You realize that would only ruin perfection if your mark survived the brilliance if they never knew
it was all orchestrated by someone. They thought god hated them or they had horseshit luck. Many people don't realize karma can be created from direct actions. We would all do well to live by that creed.
